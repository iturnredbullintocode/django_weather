Dockerized weather app
=====================
Django - Postgres - Memcached

running the app
--------------------
- Don't use any of these variables/settings in production, for the sake of speed they are sitting in the .env file, and the file is being git tracked.
- Assuming development environment will be needed friday, so django toolbar is currently set to on, as well, and project settings are dev mode.
